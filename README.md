rforSS3 is currently under development as the R package r4ss (at https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) has now included a good deal of the original functionality that I had cobbled together. r4ss now provides functions that assist with iteriatve re-weighting of the variances of composition data and also conducting Likelihood profiles so the functions that assisted with those operations are no longer needed.

rforSS3 is primarily for use when using my own strategy for running SS3.
