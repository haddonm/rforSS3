Title: Functions to Facilitate Using Stock Synthesis 3
Description: Stock Synthesis 3 is excellent software for an array of alternative
    stock assessment scenarios. rforSS3 is designed to assist with things like
    setting up new sub-directories with copies of the necessary files, 
    simplifying the process of iterative re-weighting of veriances, and 
    hopefully, simplifying its use for data-low situations.
